# Overview
With this experiment we will see how we can transfer and receive audio signals using a simple LED and solar cell plate.Li-Fi is a wireless communication technology that usesvisible light to transfer data at high speed between devices.
The process behind Li-Fi is to transfer data at high speed
using light waves from any light source indeed the ordinary
light table. Li-Fi can be considered as an optical version of
Wi-Fi, so that rather of using radio waves to transfer the data
it use Professor Harald Hass, the chairperson of Mobile
Communications at the University of Edinburgh, institute LiFi demonstrated a Li-Fi prototype at the TED Global
conference in Edinburgh on 12th July 2011.

## Working
4.1. Transfer of text:
At first the text will be typed to the source like computer /laptop/palmtop/mobile, etc in order to keep
the thing to be transmitted ready. Then the transmitting side will work in accordance with the text that
is needed to be transferred. The text will be sent to the micro controller of the transmitter side.
The text will be coded in a form to proceed for the further processing. Once the code is ready, it will
be transferred to the converter where the text that is in coded form is converted to the light
form. Then the data‟s are transferred to the receiver side when it is being placed within the
range of the light. From there the coded text is decoded and then sent to the receiver output. And
then the output is obtained on the source present on the receiver side.
4.2. Transfer of audio :
At first the voice will be recorded by the help of a voice recorder in order to keep the thing to be
transmitted ready. Then the transmitting side will work in accordance with the recorded voice that is
needed to be transferred. The voice will be sent to the micro controller of the transmitter side. There
the voice will be coded in a form to proceed for the further processing. Once the code is ready, it
will be transferred to the converter where the voice that is in coded form is converted to the
light form. Then the data‟s are transferred to the receiver side when it is being placed within the range
of the light. From there the coded voice is decoded and then sent to the receiver output. And then the
output is obtained on the speaker present on the receiver side.
